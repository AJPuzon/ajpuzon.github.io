			<p class="Center">Here are some tips and guides in navigating this webpage!</p>
				<div class="Profile">
					<div class="image">
					<img src="profiles\Profile Pics\not-found.gif">
					</div>
					<p class="Major">Hover over any monochrome images to show their true colors!</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p class="aragraph">-Hover over any <font class="Major" href="AboutLogged.html">GRAY AREAS</font> to see them pulsate!</p>
					<p class="aragraph">-Click anywhere you like! I encourage you to explore this small website</p>
					<p class="aragraph">-This website contains audio, so turn on your speakers or use some headphones!</p>
					<p class="aragraph">-This website is developed and tested on Chrome and its cohorts. Since it's only tested on such,
					compatibility issues may arise. Please ensure that you are using the latest version of Chrome.</p>
					<p class="aragraph">-Note that creating a personalized account or modifying anything just isn't possible at the moment,
					due to the programmer's laziness to implement such features. (sorry, can't do it :P) unless, you can code it for me hehe</p>
					<p class="aragraph">-This website is only a proof-of-concept and a requirement in the subject ICT 10.</p>

			<h2 class="Major">ABOUT</h2>
			<p class="aragraph"><a class="Major">Da FriendZone</a> (not to be confused with
			<a href="https://twitter.com/dasharez0ne" target="_blank">"da sharez0ne"</a>, please don't) is a 
			semi-fictional but somewhat a proof-of-concept social medium website that 
			(as of February 2019) serves only one purpose:
			</p>
			<p class="aragraph">- To list and document the somewhat "social" circles of the maker of this
				website, Persune Makat (aka G-2415)</p>
			<p class="aragraph">Please don't search him up. Respect his intention of living peacefully
				in "teh interwebz"...</p>
			<p class="aragraph">But it's not like you're able to find him by conventional means anyways...
				All you get is a bunch of perfume ads and a city called Makati, hehehe...</p>
			<p class="aragraph">This website is also inspired by the web design of modern websites and
			<a href="http://heckscaper.com" target="_blank">Emma's Homepage!</a></p>
			<p class="aragraph">The name is a play on the concept of friendzoning, something 
			for all you hopeless romantics out there! hehehe...</p>

			<h2 class="Major">MESSAGE FROM THE PROGRAMMER</h2>
			<p class="aragraph">Hi, fellow netizens! I'm Persune, some call me Dagga, others Gumball2415, but call me whatever you like! 
			(of all the three, of course :P)</p>
			<p class="aragraph">I do hope you find my website (or my programs! I run Sattelite & Stardust Software Solutions) really neat,
			because I put a lot of effort and love into making them (super complicated)! </p>
